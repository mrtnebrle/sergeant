# Sergeant

A project-aware first mate for working across multi-repo projects.

## Genesis

Sergeant was directly inspired by [firstmate](https://github.com/kunchenguid/firstmate) — an agent distro for running a crew of autonomous agents. Firstmate showed that the right unit of distribution is not a CLI tool or an MCP server, but a cloned directory of instructions, skills, and conventions that turns a general-purpose agent into a specialist.

Sergeant takes that idea and narrows the focus: instead of orchestrating a crew of agents across arbitrary tasks, it starts with the project topology. A project is a named collection of repositories. Everything — context, instructions, dispatch, graphify output — flows from that definition. Where firstmate asks "how do I run a crew?", Sergeant asks "what does this project look like, and how do I work across all of it?"

If you want a general-purpose multi-agent crew orchestrator, use firstmate. If you want your agent to deeply understand your specific projects, their repos, and how they relate — use Sergeant.

## What it is

You have a project. It has four repos: an API, a frontend, an infra chart, and a shared library. You open your agent and start working — but the agent has no idea these repos are related, what tooling each uses, or which one needs to change first when you add a new feature.

Sergeant fixes that. It is an **agent distro**: a cloned directory with an `AGENTS.md`, shell toolbelt, and skills that turn a general-purpose agent into a project-aware first mate. Launch your agent harness inside it and Sergeant takes over — it knows your projects, their repos, how they group, and what instructions apply to each one.

No install. The cloned repo is the distro. Sergeant supports Bash 3.2 and newer, including the system Bash shipped with macOS.

## Mental model

```
~/.config/sergeant/           ← project registry (one YAML per project)
  config.yaml                 ← global config (dev_root)
  smith.yaml
  myapp.yaml

~/Dev/smith/                  ← your repos
  smith-api/
  smith-app/
  smith-infra/

sergeant/                     ← this distro (you are here)
  AGENTS.md
  bin/                        ← cross-repo shell toolbelt
  skills/                     ← agent-loaded skills
```

Each project is a YAML file. That file defines which repos belong to it, how they group, where Sergeant publishes the merged graphify output, and what agent instructions apply — per group and per repo.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/callmeradical/sergeant
cd sergeant

# Set your dev root and create the config directory
mkdir -p ~/.config/sergeant
cat > ~/.config/sergeant/config.yaml << 'EOF'
dev_root: ~/Dev
EOF

# Register a project
cp schema/project.yaml.example ~/.config/sergeant/myproject.yaml
# Edit it — set your repo names and paths relative to dev_root

# Launch your agent harness — AGENTS.md takes over from here
opencode    # or: claude
```

Then talk to it:

```
> load context for myproject
> what repos are in this project?
> go work on smith-api
> add feature X across all repos
```

### No-mistakes

**Use no-mistakes as a final shipping gate, not an implementation loop.** Implementation, focused repository-native tests, lint, and independent review must be complete before starting it. A clean run takes several minutes; invoking it during development or repeatedly restarting it multiplies that cost.

#### Starting a run

Before starting: finish and commit on a feature branch, ensure `no-mistakes doctor` is healthy, and check `no-mistakes axi` for an already-active matching run — reattach rather than create a duplicate.

```bash
no-mistakes axi run --intent-file .sergeant-intent.md
# or: no-mistakes axi run --intent "<the user's objective and approved tradeoffs>"
```

Do not use `--yes`. Use `--skip=<steps>` only for stages already proven irrelevant (e.g. `--skip=document` for changes that cannot affect docs). Skipping is not a substitute for checks that have not been performed.

Routine dispatched workers do not invoke no-mistakes for ordinary completion, prototypes, investigations, documentation drafts, intermediate commits, or remediation loops. The coordinator starts a single run only after the implementation branch is committed and native validation is complete.

#### Driving gates

`axi run` and `axi respond` block while work is active — a quiet step is not a stall. Check progress with `no-mistakes axi status` without issuing duplicate run commands.

At each gate, inspect every finding:

- **`auto-fix`** — authorize selectively: `no-mistakes axi respond --action fix --findings <ids>`. Review the exact finding first.
- **`ask-user`** — relay to the user and wait for their decision. Never approve, fix, or skip autonomously.
- **`no-op`** — informational; approve the gate.

While a run is active: do not edit the pipeline-owned worktree, do not abort or rerun to escape a gate, and preserve all pipeline-created commits. Abort only when intentionally discarding the entire run.

#### Finishing

Stop driving at `checks-passed`. The PR is ready; no-mistakes monitors it in the background. Do not poll or wait for merge.

If the outcome is `failed` or `cancelled`, inspect `branch_sync` state first:
- `sync` → run `no-mistakes axi sync`
- `continue_active_run` → keep driving the reported run
- `recover_custody` → use `no-mistakes axi sync --recover`

Never improvise a reset, stash, force-push, or branch replacement around a blocked sync state.

#### Findings routing

The run is validation-only: it must not fix findings. Route actionable findings into separate, deduplicated owning-repo td tasks with `sgt-no-mistakes-finding`.

The required `--disposition` is explicit per finding: `gate` creates or updates P1 work and retains the gate, `ask-user` creates or updates P1 work and preserves human escalation, `td` creates or updates nonblocking actionable debt, and `ignore` records that no card is needed. Warning debt becomes P2, informational debt becomes P3, and repeated finding IDs update the same card while retaining the latest run ID, head SHA, location, description, and originating intent. Reruns also preserve any existing repo-specific or manually added td labels while ensuring the required `no-mistakes` and `finding` labels remain present without duplication.

On rerun, visible active cards stay in their current state, while explicitly hidden states are resurfaced: closed cards are reopened and deferred cards are undeferred before the finding body is refreshed.

Correctness, security, data-integrity, and test findings cannot be deferred or ignored. Cosmetic and evidence-only findings never create cards.

### Independent review routing

Generated worker briefs encode `review_level=medium`. Workers run focused tests
during implementation and at most one repository-required full suite, followed by
one bounded independent review pass covering documented standards and mission/spec
correctness. The review prioritizes correctness, regressions, and material scope
errors and ignores cosmetic observations and speculative refactoring. Frontend,
UI, visual, interaction, accessibility, or user-facing output work requires a
separate accessibility review; non-UI work does not. An extra risk review runs only
when repository or task policy explicitly requires it. After remediation, workers
rerun only affected tests and review checks rather than every axis or the full
suite.

Required CI, unresolved active review threads, and dependency order still gate
completion. The coordinator owns one final no-mistakes run with the default medium
profile; workers and remediation loops do not repeat it.

### Independent review findings

Dispatched workers pass each Standards, Spec, or accessibility review's strict JSON finding artifact to `sgt-review-findings`. The router creates or updates one owning-repository td task per actionable finding, preserves active task state on reruns, and publishes blocking task IDs and remediation guidance through `.sergeant-message`, `.sergeant-status`, and `sgt-notify`. Cosmetic and false-positive dispositions create no cards. The schema rejects free-form review bodies, and credential-shaped values in accepted fields are redacted before durable storage.

## Skills

Agent-loaded skills for structured workflows:

| Skill | What it does |
|---|---|
| `skills/load-project` | Load and internalize full project context |
| `skills/cross-repo-work` | Plan and execute changes across multiple repos |
| `skills/dispatch` | Dispatch subagents per repo with worktrees + briefs |

## Requirements

See the complete [getting started checklist](docs/getting-started.md) for
installation and verification.

- [`github.com/marcus/td`](https://github.com/marcus/td) — task CLI, required for brief-based `sgt-dispatch` runs, `sgt-no-mistakes-finding`, `sgt-review-findings`, and `sgt-td-*` commands; install with `brew install marcus/tap/td` or `go install github.com/marcus/td@latest`
- `yq` — YAML parser: `brew install yq`
- `python3` — callback state/protocol runtime and dispatch JSON processing
- `git` and `gh` — for repo operations and PRs
- `tmux` — for local agent dispatch
- `lsof` — for verifying cleanup does not remove an in-use worktree
- `treehouse` — pre-warmed worktree pools (optional but recommended for dispatch)
- `graphify` — knowledge graph generation (optional, needed for `sgt-graphify`)
- [`dagr`](https://github.com/callmeradical/dagr) — SQLite DAG execution engine (optional; needed only for `sgt-dag-run` and DAG-directed workflows; all other Sergeant commands work without it)
- A supported agent harness: OpenCode or Claude Code
